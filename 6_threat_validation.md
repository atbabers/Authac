# 6_threat_validation

## **6.1. Unit Tests**

Unit tests provide a foundational method for verifying the accuracy and effectiveness of detection rules. Detection engineers can test their rules by simulating different scenarios and using sample data.

---

## **6.2. Historical Analysis**

Analyzing your detection rules historically can validate their performance with your organization's data. In addition, we can use this analysis as a tool to test if your detection rules have too many false positives.

---

## **6.3. Attack Simulations**

Attack simulations mimic real cyberattacks to test the detection. Simulated attack scenarios can reveal security gaps and help engineers improve threat detection.
