## **5.1. Configuration-Based Detection**

Detecting malicious or unexpected system configuration changes can prevent threats that leverage misconfigurations.

- **Proactive Threat Prevention**: Detects vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, reducing potential attack vectors.
- **Enhanced System Integrity**: Ensures system configurations remain consistent with security best practices.
- **Quick Incident Response**: Immediate identification of unauthorized changes allows for faster remediation.

---

## **5.2. Indicator-Based Detection**

Recognize known patterns of malicious activities by leveraging predefined indicators of compromise (IoC) to identify known malicious activities.

- **Immediate Threat Recognition**: Identifies threats based on known patterns, speeding up the response time.
- **Dynamic Defense**: Allows for easy updates as we identify new IoCs, keeping defenses current.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: By focusing on known IoCs, resources arenâ€™t wasted on benign activities.

## **5.3. Model-Based Detection**

Use statistical and machine learning models to predict and detect unusual patterns.

- **Adaptive Threat Detection**: Learns from ongoing data flow to recognize new, unseen attack patterns.
- **Reduced False Positives**: Machine learning models can better differentiate between normal and anomalous behaviors.
- **Scalable**: Capable of processing vast amounts of data to identify threats in large-scale environments.

## **5.4. Behavior-Based Detection**

Focus on the behavior of entities, users, or systems to recognize activities that deviate from established patterns.

- **Deep Insight**: Provides a holistic view of user or system activities, capturing complex threat behaviors.
- **Dynamic Anomaly Detection**: Frequently updates what is considered *normal*, adjusting to legitimate changes in behavior.
- **User-Centric Defense**: Designed to spot insider threats or compromised user credentials.
