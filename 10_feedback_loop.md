## **10.1. Refinement of Detection Strategies**

- **Alert Tuning**: Based on false positives and false negatives, adjust alert parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Regularly integrate threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on the latest threat indicators and tactics.
- **Test and Drill**: Periodically conduct red teaming or penetration testing exercises to test the effectiveness of detection strategies and refine them based on findings.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Use feedback from the security operations center (SOC), incident response teams, and other relevant stakeholders to improve detection rules and strategies.
- **Periodic Review and Retire**: Regularly review detection rules to ensure all rules are relevant, retiring outdated ones as needed.

## **10.2. Threat Model Evolution**

- **Emerging Threats**: Whenever novel attack methods or vulnerabilities emerge, refresh the threat model to encompass these aspects. Staying updated ensures that the organization remains prepared and resilient against developing threats.
- **Environmental Changes**: As the technological landscape of the organization undergoes changes, itâ€™s imperative that the threat model is adjusted to mirror these evolutions. This ensures the model remains relevant and accurately represents potential risks.
- **Lessons Learned**: Following every security incident, refine the threat model, drawing from the lessons learned. Such iterative improvements make the system more robust and prepared for future challenges.
